# Course coordinator 
## C++ project with GUI that enables users to schedule course enrollments and administrator to control course information. Imported Graphics.hpp and Window.hpp in SFML to achieve GUI
### TODO List
1. Complete EnrollmentStrategies
2. GUI improvements
3. Fix fonts using bugs

### NOTICE: 
1. Inside Main.cpp, make sure change the path of fonts to your own relative path, due to some reasons it can't be properly used if I just put it as assets/fonts...
2. To enter the password, press ENTER to go to next line then click Login
