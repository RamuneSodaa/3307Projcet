### TO-DO List
1. Implementation
   - Classses
      - PrerequisiteChecker.cpp
      - EnrollmentStrategies.cpp
   - Interface
     - Login Interface
     - Main page
     - Course Searching page
     - Instructor page
      
3. UML Diagrams
- Class Diagrams: Include all classes, attributes, methods, and relationships such as inheritance, aggregation, and composition.  
- Sequence Diagrams: Show interactions between objects for key system processes.  
- Use Case Diagrams: Provide a high-level overview of user interactions and system functionality.

5. Documentation  
• Design Documentation:  
   o Explain your system’s overall architecture.  
   o Discuss how OOD principles were applied and their role in achieving a scalable, maintainable, and efficient design.
   
• Design Patterns:  
o Justify your choice of design patterns and describe how they improved the
system.
• Testing Report:
o Focus on unit testing using Google Test (GTest) and mocking with Google
Mock (gMock).
o Minimum Testing Requirement:
▪ Test at least two key classes using mocks to simulate dependencies and
verify interactions.
▪ Include examples of EXPECT_CALL statements and test cases for critical
functionality and edge cases.
o Include explanations of:
▪ How mocks were created and used.
▪ The test results and how they validate the system.
o Provide a summary of the testing outcomes and discuss how edge cases and
potential issues were handled.
• Reflection on Challenges:
o Summarize the challenges faced during the project and explain how they were
addressed
